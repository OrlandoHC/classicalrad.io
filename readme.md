## What is it?

A distraction-free, web-based, mobile-friendly directory and player for classical radio stations.

You can use it at [classicalrad.io](http://classicalrad.io). More of the rationale is [here](http://classicalrad.io).

## Plans

I’d like to add more general .pls file format support, right now the streams are hard-coded.

And there’s no reason this couldn’t be used for other kinds of radio.
