## What is it?

A distraction-free, web-based, mobile-friendly directory and player for classical radio stations.

You can use it at [classicalrad.io](http://classicalrad.io). More of the rationale is [here](http://classicalrad.io/about).

## Feedback

…and pull requests are welcome. Try me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/clipperhouse).

## Plans

I’d like to add more general .pls file format support, right now the streams are hard-coded.

I’d like to start collecting stats on how long it takes for streams to start playing, and possibly stop linking to the slow ones.

And there’s no reason this couldn’t be used for other kinds of radio.
