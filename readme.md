## What is it?

A distraction-free, web-based, mobile-friendly directory and player for classical radio stations.

You can use it at [classicalrad.io](http://classicalrad.io). More of the rationale is [here](http://classicalrad.io/about).

## Feedback

## Plans

I’d like to add more general .pls file format support, right now the streams are hard-coded.

I’d like to start collecting stats on how long it takes for streams to start playing, and possibly stop linking to the slow ones.

Sort out why streams play and others don’t. Not a small thing to sort.

Replace "time playing" with custom implementation instead of relying on player’s time event, which seems to crap out after a while.

And there’s no reason this couldn’t be used for other kinds of radio.
